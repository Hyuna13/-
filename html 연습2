    <p>Jeju Olle’s first route connects Oreums to the ocean. The route starts near Siheung Elementary School and connects to an evergreen field, Malmi Oreum(small extinct volcano) and Al Oreum(small extinct volcano) with a panoramic view of Seongsan Ilchulbong(peak) and U-do Island.<br> This view, the green fields with Jeju’s signature black stone wall, resembles a patchwork of colorful cloth. Passing Jongdal-ri old salt flat and Siheung-ri coastal road and you will arrive at Sumapo Beach with an impressive view of Seongsan Ilchulbong(peak).<br> Finally, the color of the ocean and algae covered rocks at Gwangchigi Beach is simply stunning. </p>
